## 1. Abstract & Executive Summary

Moonphase Protocol (MPCT) introduces a revolutionary blockchain ecosystem where celestial mechanics meet decentralized finance. Deployed on Solana with a fixed supply of 2.1 billion MPCT tokens, we pioneer **Proof-of-Contribution and Stake (PoCS)**, a consensus mechanism harmonizing capital commitment with active participation.

**Core Innovations:**
- 🌙 **Lunar Economics:** Dynamic rewards mirroring moon phases
- 🔄 **Three-State Token Progression:** Locked → Restricted → Transferable
- 🛡️ **Advanced Security Suite:** Slashing, Sybil resistance, MEV protection
- 💸 **Sustainable Tokenomics:** Deflationary burns, dynamic fee decay
