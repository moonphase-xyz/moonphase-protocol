## [v2.2] — Whitepaper Finalization & Structural Alignment
**Release Date:** 2026-02  
**Status:** Stable

### Overview
Version 2.2 represents a comprehensive rewrite and structural refinement of the Moonphase Protocol whitepaper.  
This release focuses on clarity, consistency, economic discipline, and governance safety.

No changes were made to the fixed total supply of MPCT or core economic invariants.

---

### Added
- Complete restructuring of the whitepaper into **14 formal sections**
- Dedicated sections for:
  - Lunar Economics (Operational Mechanics)
  - Validator Economy & APR Dynamics
  - Security, Compliance & Risk Management
  - Governance & MoonDAO
  - Roadmap & Development Milestones
  - Use Cases & Ecosystem Integration
  - Conclusion & Long-Term Vision
  - References & Appendices
- Explicit **Emission Neutrality Principle**
- Formalized **Proof-of-Contribution Reward Model**
- Governance evolution roadmap and risk disclosure
- Incident response and recovery framework

---

### Changed
- Reframed Lunar Economics from symbolic narrative to **deterministic timing mechanism**
- Clarified APR as a **participation-dependent variable**, not a guaranteed return
- Strengthened presale positioning as **economically neutral**
- Aligned validator incentives strictly with contribution and performance
- Rewrote governance model with clear authority distribution and capture resistance
- Replaced date-driven roadmap with **milestone-based development phases**
- Updated README.md to align with Whitepaper v2.2 language and constraints

---

### Removed
- Any language implying:
  - guaranteed yield or fixed APR
  - price appreciation or investment outcomes
  - presale-based economic privilege

- Symbolic lunar references without operational relevance
- Community metrics and speculative growth claims

---

### Security & Compliance Notes

- Introduced privacy-preserving compliance framework
- Added explicit participant risk disclosure
- Defined governance-constrained privileged operations

---

### Documentation
- Whitepaper renamed and finalized as:
  - `Moonphase_Whitepaper_v2.2.md`
- Legacy version retained for reference:
  - `Moonphase_Whitepaper_v2.1.md`

---

## [v2.1] — Prior Public Draft
**Status:** Deprecated

### Notes
