## Overview

Moonphase Protocol is a **fixed-supply blockchain ecosystem** designed for long-term sustainability through disciplined incentives, contribution-weighted participation, and governance-constrained evolution.

Built on Solana, the protocol introduces **Proof-of-Contribution and Stake (PoCS)** and **Lunar Economics**—a deterministic timing framework that coordinates incentive distribution without inflating token supply.

Moonphase Protocol does not promise yield, price appreciation, or short-term returns.  
It is designed to **endure across market cycles**, not optimize for speculation.

---

## Core Design Principles

- **Fixed Supply Integrity**  
  The total supply of MPCT is permanently capped at **2.1 billion tokens**.

- **Contribution Over Capital**  
  Rewards and influence scale with sustained participation and contribution, not token ownership alone.

- **Lunar Economics**  
  Cycle-based incentive timing that redistributes rewards over time without increasing emissions.

- **Governance-Constrained Evolution**  
  Protocol parameters may evolve only within predefined economic and security guardrails.

---

## Key Protocol Components

- **Proof-of-Contribution and Stake (PoCS)**  
  A participation framework combining staking with measurable contribution and performance.

- **Three-State Token Model**  
  Progressive token states governing liquidity, reward eligibility, and governance access.

- **MoonDAO Governance**  
  On-chain governance designed to resist capture and enforce protocol invariants.

---

## Token Overview

- **Token Symbol:** MPCT  
- **Total Supply:** 2,100,000,000 (Fixed)  
- **Network:** Solana  
- **Standard:** SPL  

MPCT does not represent equity, dividends, or guaranteed returns.

---

## Security & Participation

- Non-custodial staking by design  
- Validator accountability through economic security mechanisms  
- Modular, auditable smart contract architecture  

Participation involves technical, economic, and governance risks.  
There are **no guaranteed outcomes**.
