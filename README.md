## 📘 Overview

Moonphase Protocol is a blockchain protocol design framework that aligns economic participation with **cyclical temporal mechanics**, inspired by lunar phases.

The protocol introduces **Lunar Economics**, an operational incentive model where rewards, participation intensity, and contribution weight are modulated by deterministic cycle states rather than static emission assumptions.

Moonphase Protocol does **not** promise yields, fixed APRs, or price outcomes.  
All economic behavior is defined by transparent rules, contribution metrics, and governance constraints.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- 🌗 **Lunar Economics**  
  Cycle-based incentive modulation derived from deterministic phase states.

- ⚙️ **Proof-of-Contribution and Stake (PoCS)**  
  A reward model where staking weight is conditional on measurable contribution.

- 🔐 **Three-State Token Model**  
  Locked → Restricted → Transferable state progression enforced by protocol rules.

- 🏛️ **MoonDAO Governance**  
  Multi-layer governance architecture with capture resistance and constrained authority.

- 🛡️ **Security-by-Design**  
  Non-custodial staking, slashing conditions, audit-first smart contract lifecycle.

## 📊 Token Overview

- **Token Name:** Moonphase Token  
- **Symbol:** MPCT  
- **Total Supply:** 2,100,000,000 (Fixed)  
- **Network:** Solana  
- **Standard:** SPL Token  

> No minting expansion, rebasing, or discretionary supply modification mechanisms exist.

## 🏗️ Roadmap Philosophy

Moonphase Protocol follows a **milestone-based roadmap**, not date-driven commitments.

Planned phases include:
1. Specification Finalization ✅
2. Smart Contract Architecture Design
3. Testnet Deployment
4. Security Audits
5. Governance Activation
6. Ecosystem Integration

Each phase is gated by completion criteria and governance review.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Risk Disclosure

- Participation is non-custodial by design
- Rewards are variable and contribution-dependent
- Governance authority is constrained and auditable
- Economic behavior is subject to protocol rules, not discretionary promises

Participation implies acceptance of technical, economic, and governance risks as outlined in the whitepaper.
